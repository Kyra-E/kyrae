1. Adelokun, A. “Comparative Examination of Motifs and the Representation of Identities in Selected Works of Kamau Brathwaite and Helene Johnson.” International Journal of Literature Studies, vol. 1, no. 1, 2021, pp. 33-42, [https://al-kindipublisher.com/index.php/ijls/article/view/1920](https://al-kindipublisher.com/index.php/ijls/article/view/1920).

    In this article, Adelokun considers the literary motifs in selected works of Brathwaite and African-American poet Helene Johnson in order to identify and analyze thematic tropes such as exile and negation, and quest for identity. This source not only highlights themes present in Brathwaite’s literature, but it also provides me with a blueprint that I can apply when identifying similar themes that were addressed in the poems overlooked by the article. In my project, the findings of this resource may be expected to reflect some of the content and analysis that I provide.

2. Best, Curwen. Kamau Brathwaite and Christopher Okigbo: Art, Politics, and the Music of Ritual. Peter Lang, 2009, [https://books.google.dm/books?id=nl4zlJ8zrCAC&pg=PA22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.dm/books?id=nl4zlJ8zrCAC&pg=PA22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false).

    This book provides a comparative analysis of the work of Brathwaite and Okigbo. It examines the stances and responses of the two, reflected in their poetic works, towards issues occurring within Africa and the Caribbean during the period of Independence. This resource provides critical context of Brathwaite’s life and important historical events taking place. It will enable me to link the historical events that are featured in and/or shaped Brathwaite’s literary works.

3. Brathwaite, E. K. “The African Presence in Caribbean Literature.” Daedalus, vol. 103, no. 2, 1974, pp. 73-109, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/20024205](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20024205).

    In this article, poet Kamau Brathwaite reflected on some of the notable West African traditions and rhythmic patterns that are contained in Caribbean cultures. This article is relevant for my understanding of Brathwaite’s overall thinking of the Caribbean experience in order to better identify elements of this stance within his writing. In so doing, I can better link ideas and patterns present across his works during the 1980s.

4. Torres-Saillant, S. “The Trials of Authenticity in Kamau Brathwaite.” World Literature Today, vol. 68, no. 4, 1994, pp. 697-707, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40150612](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40150612).

    In this essay, the author highlights some of cultural, esthetic, social, political, market-related, and personal trials confronted by Brathwaite and his poetry by extension. This resource provides a focused look on literature that was not previously analyzed by the other sources. In regards to my individual project, it will provide supplemental thematic material that will guide my own analysis and project content.

5. Vettorato, C. “Transubstantiating the intimate: the role of autobiographical elements in the poetry of Kamau Brathwaite.” Études anglaises, vol. 66, 2013, pp. 497-510, [https://www.cairn.info/revue-etudes-anglaises-2013-4-page-497.htm](https://www.cairn.info/revue-etudes-anglaises-2013-4-page-497.htm).

    This article, unlike previous sources, considers the significance of autobiographical elements present in Brathwaite’s work. It takes a look at Brathwaite’s own personal history and describes how these events played a role in shaping his writing. This resource offers a new angle for examining Brathwaite’s work by providing new themes previously unaddressed. As such, this source provides me with good background material for connecting similar ideas within Brathwaite’s literature.
