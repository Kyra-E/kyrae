**Project Title**
Thematic Experience of Kamau Braithwaite’s 1980s Literary Works

**Purpose and Justification**

Edward Kamau Brathwaite (1930 - 2020) was a critically acclaimed poet, scholar, and cultural theorist. His “lyrical poetry wove together the history and imagery of his native Barbados, the Caribbean and the African diaspora” (Genzlinger, 2020).

“Thematic Experience of Kamau Braithwaite’s 1980s Literary Works” will attempt to link significant historical events, and trends occurring within the Caribbean and to its people to the major themes addressed in his works originally published during the 1980s. It will attempt to identify:
* The historical driving forces behind Brathwaite’s writing in the 1980s; and
* Any linking themes between his 1980 works.

The impetus to conduct this particular project primarily came about from my individual work on the “Visualizing Caribbean Literature” project. First in compiling a list of primary Caribbean Literary texts during the period 1981- 1990, which provided fuel for this project’s time period. Then, in my work in data cleaning the spreadsheet where my interest was piqued by the historical and cultural focus in the titles of Brathwaite’s work.

**Methodology**

In light of the focus of this research, Voyant Tools and Twine will be heavily utilized to visualize the results of this project. First, the web-based Voyant Tools will be used to perform textual analysis and topic modeling of any openly accessible primary text or secondary analytical text on Brathwaite’s work during the period. This will serve to highlight any existing commonalities between works that can also assist in narrowing my thematic search and understanding of his work in general. Twine will then provide the means to link these found themes, topics, and historical contexts together and to present this work in a visually pleasing format. All in all, this project is shaping out itself to become an interactive storytelling experience of Brathwaite’s 1980 [works](about.markdown).
